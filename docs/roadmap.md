# Roadmap and release gates

Constellation is a working development preview. Checked-in code and selected live exercises establish concrete behavior; they do not establish a production-ready app or full Dashboard Studio parity.

## Product improvements

- Improve first-draft analytical quality using verified field meaning, units, population and time coverage.
- Verify related-dataset keys, grain, units and joins before suggesting comparisons.
- Expand modular, versioned guidance and evaluate semantic retrieval within the Splunk app boundary.
- Expand native visualization/option, input, token, drilldown, refresh and search-source coverage through versioned fixtures.
- Improve canvas manipulation, responsive layouts, keyboard interaction and contrast/reflow qualification.
- Qualify the complete real-data multi-page journey independently through each supported provider. Extend typed source builders to reduce repeated provider-generated scope/format errors, using the same deterministic search boundary.
- Add additional provider adapters and genuine progress/token streaming through supported Splunk transport paths.
- Reduce the renderer bundle and test performance at realistic document/data sizes.

The current reliability milestone is recorded in [the goal brief](reliability-goal.md). Before calling the authoring experience reliable for a broader audience, run unaided user trials against representative datasets, measure task completion, recovery rate, latency, rewording and undo/restore use. A target such as 90 percent completion needs measured evidence from those trials.

## Before public release

- Select and document the first-party source license; complete third-party attribution and redistribution review. Public visibility is separate from an open-source license grant.
- Review the exact Git history, source, fixtures, binary metadata and documentation for credentials, personal details and environment-specific material.
- Run publication checks and Gitleaks over the complete release history. Establish a private vulnerability-reporting path.
- Review CI permissions, dependency pins, supply-chain updates, issue templates and release artifacts. Keep deployment/provider credentials out of offline CI.
- Decide the release floor and support policy using tested Splunk/Studio/Python combinations.
- Review current AppInspect warnings and complete required certification separately from local precert checks.

## Before production qualification

- Complete non-admin owner isolation and permission/ACL tests, including administrator boundaries and failed-access paths.
- Qualify upgrade/rollback, retention and backup behavior for drafts, Trash, pending attachments and native restores.
- Qualify cross-member search-head-cluster concurrency; configuration replication is not atomic distributed coordination.
- Complete native rendering/interaction fixtures, accessibility and reflow, resource budgets and failure/timeout tests.
- Establish release artifact hashes, repeatable acceptance records and operational documentation for each supported deployment profile.

Modules and migration contracts are described in [architecture](architecture.md) and [upgrade guide](upgrade-guide.md). Future compatibility is intentionally verified at these boundaries rather than promised from a version number alone.
